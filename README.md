# us-ger
My personal keyboard layout

Based on the standard US-Keyboard-Layout with extensions for the German language.

- `AltGr + a` = `ä`
- `AltGr + s` = `ö`
- `AltGr + d` = `ü`
- `AltGr + f` = `ß`

and all of the uppercase letters when combined with shift. (yes, even ẞ)

The layout can be edited / an installable binary can be created using the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).

For comfort, I have also uploaded the installable binary to the [releases section](https://github.com/RvNovae/us-ger/release)
